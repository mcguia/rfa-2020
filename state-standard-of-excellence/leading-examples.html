Each indicator has a status (good, okay, or poor, according to specific criteria) and can be compared to the performance of other states, with many indicators disaggregated by race, income, or geography. The Minnesota Management and Budget Office uses the dashboard to convene state agencies for “state-stat” meetings to monitor performance and identify opportunities to enhance collaboration. In response to COVID-19, the state built a comprehensive public data dashboard that tracks health and economic data, including response data on hospital capacity, critical care supplies, child care, and funding. The dashboard also tracks the disparate impacts of the virus on communities of color to enhance collaboration with stakeholders and “eliminate systemic barriers so communities of color and indigenous communities can recover with dignity and resiliency.” Such a collaboration includes an ongoing partnership with J-PAL North America that has leveraged the data to identify how to increase take up of COVID-19 testing in Black, Latinx, immigrant, and Native American communities based on local priorities and preferences. The Governor regularly briefs the public on progress being made on these goals.</p></div></div><div class="row align-center"><div class="column large-10"><hr class="hr--long"></div></div><div class="row align-center" id="data-leadership"><div class="column large-8 medium-8 small-12"><h3 class="example__title--leading">3.

As a result of this and similar laws, WSIPP has published cost-benefit analyses in a wide variety of issue areas over the past 10 years. The WSIPP cost-benefit framework has been widely adopted by governments across the country.</p></div></div><div class="row align-center"><div class="column large-10"><hr class="hr--long"></div></div><div class="row align-center" id="use-of-evidence-in-grant-programs"><div class="column large-8 medium-8 small-12"><h3 class="example__title--leading">12.

This represented an increase over the approximately 15% of funds that had been allocated based on level of evidence in the 2016-2017 school year. Grant recipients may set aside funds to monitor and evaluate the identified evidence-based approaches to ensure the investments yield a positive impact on student outcomes.</p><p>Beginning in 2017, the Nevada Department of Education also began requiring school districts to invest awarded funds from two additional federal grant programs in interventions that meet one of the four tiers of evidence (strong, moderate, promising, and under evaluation) defined in ESSA: (1) ESSA Title IV-B ($9 million in 2017-2018), for the competitive 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants; and (2) ESSA Title IV-A grants ($9.4 million in federal funds to Nevada in 2017-2018 to increase students’ access to a well-rounded education), where applications with stronger evidence are considered for funding before other applications.</p><p>Starting in 2013, the Nevada State Legislature passed a series of laws with strong evidence requirements that aligned state education funding with ESSA’s tiered evidence definition.

This innovative assessment tool is a “model of models,” which incorporates the statistical projections of several leading research institutions. Notably, the assessment tool allows residents to create their own scenarios for transmission potential in the coming months depending on specific public health guidelines. Further, California released the source data sets on California’s Open Data Portal, allowing the public to examine the data underlying the Assessment Tool.</p><p>The California Government Operations Agency (GovOps), which serves as an umbrella organization for the state’s innovation work, is designed to institutionalize policies, tools, and training that can drive its mission to modernize the processes of government through lean process improvement, data, leadership, and performance improvement. GovOps brings together statewide initiatives such as the Lean Academy, California Leadership Academy, the Office of Digital Innovation, and California’s Open Data Portal resources. As well, the California Health and Human Services Agency has an Office of Innovation that focuses on improving programs and services through the use of tools such as human-centered design and data analytics.</p></div></div><div class="row align-center"><div class="column large-10"><hr class="hr--long"></div></div><div class="row align-center" id="contracting-for-outcomes"><div class="column large-8 medium-8 small-12"><h3 class="example__title--leading">14.

As part of this initiative, the department executed $90 million in 116 results-driven contracts that require providers to meet outcome goals rather than output metrics. As a result, the Department has reduced the number of children in group care by over 20% since 2015, experienced a 50%expansion of foster care resources for the most challenging adolescents, doubled the capacity of high-quality family visitation and reunification services, and made start-up investments of $1.2 million in nonprofit community organizations to support new and expanded programming.</p><p>Also in 2015, the Department of Labor and Training launched Real Jobs Rhode Island, an innovative, $14 million workforce program that used performance-based metrics and active contract management. As a result, the state reconfigured the way it manages and evaluates its job training programs to capture meaningful, long-term employment outcomes and created a Strategic Coaching Procurement Playbook, which includes specific strategies and sample language for using active contract management to achieve better results.</p><p>Rhode Island Works, administered by the Department of Human Services, also used performance payments and active contract management to improve its job search services, which, in 2015, ranked at the bottom nationally on the federal measure of work participation rate (which counts the number of recipients engaged in work-related activities as a share of all work-eligible clients receiving benefits). To improve the program, the Department partnered with the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab to incorporate performance-based payments for self-sufficiency outcomes and deploy active contract management. As a result, the federal participation rate improved by one-third within the first six months after these reforms were launched.</p></div></div><div class="row align-center"><div class="column large-10"><hr class="hr--long"></div></div><div class="row align-center" id="repurpose-for-results"><div class="column large-8 medium-8 small-12"><h3 class="example__title--leading">15.

Following the introduction of these performance goals, the program’s recidivism rate dropped by 11.3% in 2014, another 16% in 2015, and an additional 11% in 2016.
