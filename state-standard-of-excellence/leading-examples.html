As part of this initiative, the department executed $90 million in 116 results-driven contracts that require providers to meet outcome goals rather than output metrics. As a result, the Department has reduced the number of children in group care by over 20% since 2015, experienced a 50%expansion of foster care resources for the most challenging adolescents, doubled the capacity of high-quality family visitation and reunification services, and made start-up investments of $1.2 million in nonprofit community organizations to support new and expanded programming.</p><p>Also in 2015, the Department of Labor and Training launched Real Jobs Rhode Island, an innovative, $14 million workforce program that used performance-based metrics and active contract management.

To improve the program, the Department partnered with the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab to incorporate performance-based payments for self-sufficiency outcomes and deploy active contract management.
