    Beginning in 2011, the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) has [required programs that receive its grant funding](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 13) to “allocate a percentage of their OASAS funded prevention efforts to the delivery of evidence-based programs and strategies.” The percentage started at [35% in 2011](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 14) and escalated to 50% in 2014 and 70% in 2018. To assist in the implementation of evidence-based programs, OASAS created a [Registry of Evidence-based Programs](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) and Strategies (p. 12). Promising programs can be proposed to a [state panel for approval and inclusion](http://www.npnconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NPN2016-OASAS-EBP-Panel_Part-1and2.PowerPoint.pdf) in the [OASAS registry](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/evidence/EBPSList.cfm).

    The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services has increased its funding of evidence-based interventions, targeting [75% of its alternative to incarceration funds](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/11/rf_nys_case_study.pdf) (pp. 5–6) toward evidence-based interventions in FY2015–2016. This funding target was based on the department’s [technical report](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/rf-technical_report_cba1_oct2013.pdf) and [cost-benefit analysis](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/net-impact-table-with-guide.pdf) to outline the impact, costs, and benefits of specific criminal justice interventions.

    A [2007 Tennessee law](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/) requires that 100% of the state’s juvenile justice funding be evidence-based ([section 4e](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/)) beginning in 2012, with the exception of pilot programs that are building the evidence basis for research or theory-based interventions. As a result, the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services’ 2017 [Request for Proposal](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/dcs/documents/for-providers/procurement/Grant_AOF_Mandatory_Reqs.pdf) for juvenile justice services noted that “the Department of Children’s Services is prohibited from expending state funds on any juvenile justice program . . . unless the program is evidence-based” (p. 23). The law also established [in 37-5-121(a)] the following four levels of evidence for the juvenile justice programs operated by the Department of Children’s Services: evidence-based, research-based, theory-based, or pilot.

    by the Colorado Department of Revenue to assess if nudges would increase taxpayer
    responses (and payment) of delinquent taxes. The randomized controlled trial found
    that by rewording delinquent tax notifications, the state could increase the payments
    it collected by up to 4.1% for no additional cost. Based on this experiment, Colorado
    is expanding these techniques to other departments and launched a pilot to use
    behavioral economics insights to improve programs in five areas in 2017.

    A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, and counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” (Section [256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)).

    A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows the state to use the savings achieved from reducing the sentences of minor drug offenders for evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for offenders still in prison or under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/), which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf#page=29) that providing offenders drug treatment reduces recidivism rates.
