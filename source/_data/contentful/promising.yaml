    Beginning in 2011, the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) has [required programs that receive its grant funding](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 13) to “allocate a percentage of their OASAS funded prevention efforts to the delivery of evidence-based programs and strategies.” The percentage started at [35% in 2011](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 14) and escalated to 50% in 2014 and 70% in 2018. To assist in the implementation of evidence-based programs, OASAS created a [Registry of Evidence-based Programs](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) and Strategies (p. 12). Promising programs can be proposed to a [state panel for approval and inclusion](http://www.npnconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NPN2016-OASAS-EBP-Panel_Part-1and2.PowerPoint.pdf) in the [OASAS registry](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/evidence/EBPSList.cfm).

    The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services has increased its funding of evidence-based interventions, targeting [75% of its alternative to incarceration funds](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/11/rf_nys_case_study.pdf) (pp. 5–6) toward evidence-based interventions in FY2015–2016. This funding target was based on the department’s [technical report](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/rf-technical_report_cba1_oct2013.pdf) and [cost-benefit analysis](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/net-impact-table-with-guide.pdf) to outline the impact, costs, and benefits of specific criminal justice interventions.

    A [2007 Tennessee law](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/) requires that 100% of the state’s juvenile justice funding be evidence-based ([section 4e](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/)) beginning in 2012, with the exception of pilot programs that are building the evidence basis for research or theory-based interventions. As a result, the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services’ 2017 [Request for Proposal](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/dcs/documents/for-providers/procurement/Grant_AOF_Mandatory_Reqs.pdf) for juvenile justice services noted that “the Department of Children’s Services is prohibited from expending state funds on any juvenile justice program . . . unless the program is evidence-based” (p. 23). The law also established [in 37-5-121(a)] the following four levels of evidence for the juvenile justice programs operated by the Department of Children’s Services: evidence-based, research-based, theory-based, or pilot.

    by the Colorado Department of Revenue to assess if nudges would increase taxpayer
    responses (and payment) of delinquent taxes. The randomized controlled trial found
    that by rewording delinquent tax notifications, the state could increase the payments
    it collected by up to 4.1% for no additional cost. Based on this experiment, Colorado
    is expanding these techniques to other departments and launched a pilot to use
    behavioral economics insights to improve programs in five areas in 2017.

  long_description: In 2018, Kentucky established a Chief Data Officer as the chief
    data steward to “coordinate and oversee the sharing of data and shall implement
    effective data governance strategies designed to maintain data integrity, confidentiality,
    availability, security, and to promote access to data.” The accompanying Enterprise
    Data Management Policy established the Office of Data, Information, and Analytics
    (ODIA), led by the CDO, and required Executive Branch agencies to identify an
    Agency Data Steward that would report directly to the Cabinet Secretary or Agency
    Head. The Data Steward would carry out the functions of the data stewardship across
    the state through the master data sharing agreement, acting as liaison to the
    CDO/ODIA.

  long_description: 'Utah’s Governor’s Office of Management and Budget (GOMB) developed
    the SUCCESS framework, which is a performance formula used to calculate work,
    quality, and expenses across the government functions. In January 2013, the Governor
    challenged Cabinet-level agencies to hit a 25 percent improvement target over
    four years. As of the end of 2018, the State exceeded that goal by improving more
    than 40 percent. GOMB also supports agencies define their  performance measures
    beyond the SUCCESS’s dimensions, with lengths of stay as performance metric fortate
    hospitals, for example. As an independent agency, the Utah Department of Transportation
    has brought together data from across the system in a dashboard. Their strategic
    plan demonstrates the purpose for that dashboard, and, in a State Scoop article,
    another appeal of the dashboard was explained: “Another part of the appeal, Marshall
    said, is that the data previously only shared once a year through the agency’s
    paper-bound ‘strategic direction’ book is now accessible to the public in real
    time — allowing the department to eliminate the paper version of book entirely.”'

  long_description: Since 2012, the Colorado Department of Human Services has implemented
    a performance management framework, [C-Stat](https://www.example.com/) to improve
    delivery of food and cash assistance programs as mandated by a court order. According
    to the C-Stat website, the framework “moves CDHS to an outcomes-oriented and collaborative
    approach to affect change at every level. The goals are to collect timely data,
    increase transparency, conduct regular executive meetings to assess the effectiveness
    of the strategies, and to identify new performance measures, all in support of
    continuous quality improvement.” Each division within the department collects
    and reports performance data. Meetings are held weekly on a rotating basis for
    each division. The online dashboard contains data on nine systems with reports
    released quarterly. County level data is included on a dashboard. The Department’s
    Performance and Peer Exchange program, a peer exchange and learning opportunity,
    allows counties to learn from each other and produces broader learnings for the
    field, which are available online. This case study has details on design and implementation
    for policymakers.
