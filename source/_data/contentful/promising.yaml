    Beginning in 2011, the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) has [required programs that receive its grant funding](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 13) to “allocate a percentage of their OASAS funded prevention efforts to the delivery of evidence-based programs and strategies.” The percentage started at [35% in 2011](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 14) and escalated to 50% in 2014 and 70% in 2018. To assist in the implementation of evidence-based programs, OASAS created a [Registry of Evidence-based Programs](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) and Strategies (p. 12). Promising programs can be proposed to a [state panel for approval and inclusion](http://www.npnconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NPN2016-OASAS-EBP-Panel_Part-1and2.PowerPoint.pdf) in the [OASAS registry](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/evidence/EBPSList.cfm).

    The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services has increased its funding of evidence-based interventions, targeting [75% of its alternative to incarceration funds](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/11/rf_nys_case_study.pdf) (pp. 5–6) toward evidence-based interventions in FY2015–2016. This funding target was based on the department’s [technical report](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/rf-technical_report_cba1_oct2013.pdf) and [cost-benefit analysis](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/net-impact-table-with-guide.pdf) to outline the impact, costs, and benefits of specific criminal justice interventions.

    A [2007 Tennessee law](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/) requires that 100% of the state’s juvenile justice funding be evidence-based ([section 4e](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/)) beginning in 2012, with the exception of pilot programs that are building the evidence basis for research or theory-based interventions. As a result, the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services’ 2017 [Request for Proposal](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/dcs/documents/for-providers/procurement/Grant_AOF_Mandatory_Reqs.pdf) for juvenile justice services noted that “the Department of Children’s Services is prohibited from expending state funds on any juvenile justice program . . . unless the program is evidence-based” (p. 23). The law also established [in 37-5-121(a)] the following four levels of evidence for the juvenile justice programs operated by the Department of Children’s Services: evidence-based, research-based, theory-based, or pilot.

    by the Colorado Department of Revenue to assess if nudges would increase taxpayer
    responses (and payment) of delinquent taxes. The randomized controlled trial found
    that by rewording delinquent tax notifications, the state could increase the payments
    it collected by up to 4.1% for no additional cost. Based on this experiment, Colorado
    is expanding these techniques to other departments and launched a pilot to use
    behavioral economics insights to improve programs in five areas in 2017.

    created the [Utah Data Research Center](https://udrc.utah.gov/) to [integrate](https://udrc.utah.gov/UDRCP20MetricsD3DataNarrative/PostRed.html)
    data from the Utah System of Higher Education, Utah System of Technical Colleges,
    Utah State Board of Education, Utah Department of Health, and the Utah Department
    of Workforce Services. The Center has a [research agenda](https://udrc.utah.gov/research.html)
    and [provides](https://udrc.utah.gov/jsp/researcher/products) both “data products”
    and “data-as-a-product.” The Center’s [governance structure](https://jobs.utah.gov/edo/udrcadvisory/udrcgovernance.pdf)
    includes [staff](https://udrc.utah.gov/team.html), an [advisory board](https://www.utah.gov/pmn/sitemap/publicbody/6073.html)
    of agency designees, an [institutional review board](https://udrc.utah.gov/USBE-IRB-Policy-v2.pdf),

  long_description: The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services
    maintains an [Integrated Client Database](http://www.aisp.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WAState_CaseStudy.pdf)
    with data from [10 state agencies](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sites/default/files/SESA/rda/documents/research-11-205.pdf),
    40 separate data systems, and 2.4 million individuals. This data is used for rapid-cycle
    policy analysis, program evaluation, [predictive modeling](https://ocio-website-files.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Digital-States-Survey-PRISM-Predictive-Risk-App.pdf),
    and performance measurement to help agencies understand how health and other factors
    are related to outcomes for persons served by public assistance programs. The
    database has been used by the state’s [Health Home Program](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/altsa/washington-health-home-program),
    which  provides intensive care management services to high-risk Medicaid beneficiaries,
    to improve beneficiary health outcomes and lower costs. These lower costs have
    included [over $20 million in savings](https://www.cms.gov/blog/washington-mffs-preliminary-evaluation-report)
    to the state as well as tens of millions in dollars in shared savings [payments](https://www.hca.wa.gov/about-hca/health-home-program-saves-more-100-million-medicare-program-over-three-years)
    from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has [evaluated](https://innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/fai-wa-secondevalrpt.pdf)
    the program and encouraged other states to consider developing similar programs.

  long_description: The Wisconsin [Early Childhood Integrated Data System](https://dpi.wi.gov/early-childhood/ecids)
    integrates data from the state Departments of Children and Families, Health Services,
    and Public Instruction. The system links, collects, and monitors early childhood
    data from 11 [state programs](https://dpi.wi.gov/early-childhood/ecids/ecids-rtt-project).
    The state engaged in [an inclusive planning process](https://dpi.wi.gov/early-childhood/ecids/ecids-history)
    to design the system which, although not an integrated data warehouse, provides
    for [data sharing](https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/early-childhood/WI-ECIDS-fact-sheet-final.pdf)
    among relevant state agencies. The system also has strong privacy protections,
    including an overarching [memorandum of understanding](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13MfIzsU1p2KzFPpTlsBKwMWjTLrzrnya)
    and individual data sharing agreements from the Departments of [Children and Families](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q6DOmS9FzSyo9Jng1VsX-Q8bnp5k6Gut),
    [Health Services](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pL4Skkfu5ULg6Xbzent_qNi5kOtT4H9M),
    and [Public Instruction](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yLGQC9y1SzbVJPPuM4k3m2ufs78MtKVE),
    which are used with each inter-agency data sharing project.
