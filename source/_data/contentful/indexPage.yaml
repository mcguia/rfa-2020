    The 2018 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets a national standard – a “north star” – for how state governments can consistently and effectively use data and evidence in budget, policy, and management decisions to achieve better outcomes for their residents.

    - Results for America identified 88 leading and promising data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies, programs, and systems in effect in April 2018 in 30 states across the country.

    - Five states are recognized as leading the way with their data-driven and evidence-based examples: Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, and Tennessee.

    - We identified these examples across 15 criteria: Strategic Goals, Performance Management/Continuous Improvement, Data Leadership, Data Policies/Agreements, Data Use, Evaluation Leadership, Evaluation Policies, Evaluation Resources, Outcome Data, Evidence Definition and Program Inventory, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Use of Evidence in Grant Programs, Innovation, Contracting for Outcomes, and Repurpose for Results.

    The purpose of the 2018 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence is to inform policymakers and the public about state governments’ use of data, evidence, and evaluation to invest taxpayer dollars in what works. By identifying specific efforts currently underway in state governments, Results for America hopes to facilitate the broader adoption of evidence-based policymaking in state governments across the country.

    Results for America’s analysis is based on data provided under license by the [Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative) (which was used to inform its [2017 report](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2017/01/how-states-engage-in-evidence-based-policymaking) on states’ engagement in evidence-based policymaking) and input from more than 90 current and former state government officials and other experts.<sup>1</sup>

    title: Contracting for Outcomes
    order: 14
    description: Did the state or any of its agencies enter into performance-based
      contracts and/or use active contract management (frequent use of data and regular
      communication with providers to monitor implementation and progress) to improve
      outcomes for publicly funded programs?
    explanation: |-
      __Why is this important?__<br>
      These contracting techniques allow state governments to get better results and value for each taxpayer dollar.

    title: Repurpose for Results
    order: 15
    description: Did the state or any of its agencies shift funds away from any practice,
      policy, or program which consistently failed to achieve desired outcomes?
    explanation: |-
      __Why is this important?__<br>
      Repurposing funds from programs that fail to consistently achieve results to programs that consistently achieve results is a key strategy for state governments to improve their performance while building knowledge about what works.

    The 2019 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets a national standard – a “north star” – for how state governments can consistently and effectively use data and evidence in budget, policy, and management decisions to achieve better outcomes for their residents.

    - Results for America identified 88 leading and promising data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies, programs, and systems in effect in April 2018 in 30 states across the country.

    - Five states are recognized as leading the way with their data-driven and evidence-based examples: Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, and Tennessee.

    - We identified these examples across 15 criteria: Strategic Goals, Performance Management/Continuous Improvement, Data Leadership, Data Policies/Agreements, Data Use, Evaluation Leadership, Evaluation Policies, Evaluation Resources, Outcome Data, Evidence Definition and Program Inventory, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Use of Evidence in Grant Programs, Innovation, Contracting for Outcomes, and Repurpose for Results.

    The purpose of the 2019 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence is to inform policymakers and the public about state governments’ use of data, evidence, and evaluation to invest taxpayer dollars in what works. By identifying specific efforts currently underway in state governments, Results for America hopes to facilitate the broader adoption of evidence-based policymaking in state governments across the country.

    Results for America’s analysis is based on data provided under license by the [Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative) (which was used to inform its [2017 report](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2017/01/how-states-engage-in-evidence-based-policymaking) on states’ engagement in evidence-based policymaking) and input from more than 90 current and former state government officials and other experts.<sup>1</sup>
