    The 2018 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets a national standard – a “north star” – for how state governments can consistently and effectively use data and evidence in budget, policy, and management decisions to achieve better outcomes for their residents.

    - Results for America identified 88 leading and promising data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies, programs, and systems in effect in April 2018 in 30 states across the country.

    - Five states are recognized as leading the way with their data-driven and evidence-based examples: Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, and Tennessee.

    - We identified these examples across 15 criteria: Strategic Goals, Performance Management/Continuous Improvement, Data Leadership, Data Policies/Agreements, Data Use, Evaluation Leadership, Evaluation Policies, Evaluation Resources, Outcome Data, Evidence Definition and Program Inventory, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Use of Evidence in Grant Programs, Innovation, Contracting for Outcomes, and Repurpose for Results.

    The purpose of the 2018 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence is to inform policymakers and the public about state governments’ use of data, evidence, and evaluation to invest taxpayer dollars in what works. By identifying specific efforts currently underway in state governments, Results for America hopes to facilitate the broader adoption of evidence-based policymaking in state governments across the country.

    Results for America’s analysis is based on data provided under license by the [Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative) (which was used to inform its [2017 report](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2017/01/how-states-engage-in-evidence-based-policymaking) on states’ engagement in evidence-based policymaking) and input from more than 90 current and former state government officials and other experts.<sup>1</sup>

  short_description: "The 2019 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets
    a national standard—a “north star”—for how state governments can consistently
    and effectively use evidence and data in budget, policy, and management decisions
    to achieve better outcomes for their residents.\n\nIn the 2019 Invest in What
    Works State Standard of Excellence (State Standard of Excellence), Results for
    America identified 125 examples of data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies,
    programs, and systems in effect as of June 2019 in 33 states across the country.\n\nOverall,
    five states are leading the way with their use of data-driven and evidence-based
    practices, policies, programs, and systems. These Leading States are Colorado,
    Minnesota, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Three states are Rising Stars that have
    significantly increased their evidence and data efforts: Maryland (from three
    promising examples in 2018 to six in 2019), Nevada (new leading example of using
    evidence in nine education grant programs), and North Carolina (from one promising
    example in 2018 to four in 2019).  \n\nThe 2019 State Standard of Excellence shows
    how state governments are using evidence and data to improve results for their
    residents by investing in what works. The examples of data-driven and evidence-based
    practices, policies, programs, and systems in the 2019 State Standard of Excellence
    demonstrate that state governments thrive when they incorporate evidence-based
    policy into their budget, policy, and management decisions. Moreover, the efforts
    of these state governments are informing their peers, policymakers, and the public
    about the effectiveness of using evidence and data to invest taxpayer dollars
    in what works. \n\nThe 2019 State Standard of Excellence demonstrates growing
    bipartisan momentum in state governments’ building and use of evidence and data.
    Between May 2018 and June 2019, Results for America identified an increase in
    the overall number of state government examples from 88 to 125, representing 33
    states (including five new states not represented in 2018: Arizona, Missouri,
    Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont). Particularly notable areas of growth were education
    with a 300% increase in the number of examples and workforce with a 400% increase.\n\nResults
    for America’s analysis is based on data provided under license by the [Pew-MacArthur
    Results First Initiative](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative)
    (which was used to inform its [2017 report](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2017/01/how-states-engage-in-evidence-based-policymaking)
    on states’ engagement in evidence-based policymaking) and input from more than
    150 current and former state government officials and other experts.<sup>1</sup>"

  short_description: "The Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets a
    national benchmark—a “north star”—for how state governments can consistently and
    effectively use evidence and data in budget, policy, and management decisions
    to achieve better outcomes for their residents. \n\n\nResults for America identified
    169 examples of data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies, programs,
    and systems in effect as of June 2020 in 35 states across the country.  Further,
    in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that, now more than ever, states need
    robust evidence and data capacities to make equitable decisions that affect their
    residents’ health, economic mobility, and overall well-being. \n\n\nOverall, seven
    states are leading the way with their use of data-driven and evidence-based practices,
    policies, programs, and systems. These Leading States are Colorado, Connecticut,
    Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington. Four Honor Roll States have
    also demonstrated a commitment to improving their evidence and data efforts: Massachusetts,
    North Carolina, Ohio, and Rhode Island.\n\n\nThe leading and promising examples
    highlighted in the 2020 State Standard of Excellence are informing other state
    governments, policymakers, and the public about the effectiveness of using evidence
    and data to invest taxpayer dollars in what works. To further help states meet
    the State Standard of Excellence’s national benchmarks, the recently released
    *[Blueprint for Delivering Results in State Government](https://blueprint.results4america.org/)*
    provides state leaders with implementation strategies and actions for consistently
    and effectively using evidence and data to improve residents’ lives."

    explanation: Making specific funding commitments to evaluation is critical and
      ensures that state governments have the necessary funds to evaluate whether
      state programs are achieving their desired outcomes. At the federal level, several
      agencies have made commitments to spend 1% of program funds on evaluation, which

  states_use_data_accordion: "With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, governors
    and state leaders have increasingly turned to data to guide their decision-making.
    All state governments publicly shared data on their COVID-19 emergency response
    dashboards, but states with a comprehensive data infrastructure (Criteria 3 Data
    Leadership; Criteria 4 Data Policies/Agreements; and Criteria 5 Data Use) had
    an enhanced ability to leverage a data-driven response. \n\n__COVID-19 Data Dashboards__\n\nThe
    2019 State Standard of Excellence [identified](https://2019state.results4america.org/state-standard-of-excellence/performance-management--continuous-improvement.html)
    12 states with significant public-facing performance management systems. However,
    in 2020, all 50 states launched COVID-19 dashboards to monitor public health data
    and emergency response services. This alone constitutes a significant step forward
    for state governments’ use of data-driven policymaking. \n\nMoreover, as of July
    2020, 18 governors (nearly all of them from states highlighted in the 2020 State
    Standard of Excellence) had publicly committed to taking a data-driven and/or
    evidence-based approach in their COVID-19 response. Through [daily press briefings](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-updates-new-yorkers-states-progress-during-covid-19-pandemic-4),
    governors reaffirmed their state’s commitment to a response grounded in facts,
    science, and data. In regional plans, governors agreed to [coordinate re-opening
    efforts](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493181-midwest-governors-announce-partnership-to-coordinate-reopening-economies)
    and frequently share data as hotspots emerged. These actions respond to the public
    demand for data transparency, as well as the public’s desire that their governors
    and state leaders rely on data to make decisions. A recent national poll commissioned
    by Results for America and conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago found
    that 92% of Americans believe policymakers should seek the best evidence and data
    available when making decisions. \n\n\nBeyond these efforts, several states took
    a comprehensive approach by outfitting their data dashboards with highly detailed
    information on economic, health, and demographic indicators. For example, Colorado’s
    COVID-19 [dashboard](https://covid19.colorado.gov/covid-19-data) features extensive
    data on [hospitals](https://covid19.colorado.gov/hospital-data), [outbreaks](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/outbreak-data),
    [surveillance efforts](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/surveillance-data), and
    [the incidence and epidemic curve](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/incidence-epidemic-curve)
    (see Colorado example in Criteria 5). Minnesota’s [COVID Response Capacity Tracker](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/response-capacity.jsp)
    monitors hospital surge capacity, child care capacity, and COVID-19 response funding
    in addition to [economic and food security metrics](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/economic-food-security.jsp),
    [critical care supplies](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/critical-care.jsp),
    [dial back indicators](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/dial-back-dashboard.jsp),
    and [demographic details](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/covid-dashboard/index.jsp)
    (see Minnesota example in Criteria 2). In both states, these data [informed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMCy4goH3Do)
    governors’ actions and are [leveraged](https://covid19.colorado.gov/press-release/state-launches-new-covid-19-website)
    to drive everyday decisions during the pandemic. \n\n\nMinnesota’s[ race/ethnicity
    data dashboard](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/data-by-race-ethnicity/index.jsp)
    publishes demographic COVID-19 data by age, gender, and race/ethnicity; this approach
    was mirrored in 45 other states that also released demographic data about COVID-19
    cases. The use of these disaggregated data allows states to identify disproportionately
    impacted communities, in particular, communities of color. For example, Virginia’s
    COVID-19’s [Health Equity Work Group](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/diversity/equity-leadership-taskforce/)
    (see Virginia example in Criteria 13) leveraged geospatial data to provide testing
    and personal protective equipment in communities typically underserved by government
    programs. These data enable states to tailor their response activities in equity-informed
    ways. States are also encouraging community engagement and civic innovation by
    publicly posting open data daily on state websites in [Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting#covid-19-daily-dashboard-),
    [Washington](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020COVID19/DataDashboard),
    [Connecticut](https://public.tableau.com/profile/connecticut.state.data.center#!/),
    and more. \n\n__States Leverage Data to Support Pandemic Response Efforts__\n\nAll
    50 states publicly posted coronavirus data, but states with the ability to [link,
    share, and integrate data](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/leveraging-data.html)
    were well-positioned to incorporate data insights into their response efforts.
    For example, [InnovateOhio's](https://innovateohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/innovate)
    statewide data-sharing and integration platform (see Ohio example in Criteria
    4), gave Ohio a head start by providing rapid, actionable COVID-19 data to decision-makers.
    By using an existing infrastructure, the state obtained vital information, such
    as hospital capacity, more quickly by turning quarterly data deadlines into daily
    data reports.\n\nConnecticut’s statewide data infrastructure helped the state
    leverage existing data-sharing agreements to match student and SNAP data, enabling
    students to directly receive [SNAP Pandemic EBT](https://portal.ct.gov/DSS/SNAP/Supplemental-Nutrition-Assistance-Program---SNAP)
    food benefits with no application necessary (see Connecticut example in Criteria
    5). Similarly, in administering the federal COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance
    program, Rhode Island’s Department of Labor and Training launched an improved
    [cloud-based system](https://results4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pandemic-Unemployment-Assistance-Benefits-System-1-1.pdf)
    to manage the surge in unemployment claims. This system enabled Rhode Island,
    a model for other states, to be among the first states in the country to allocate
    Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits in the face of record-high unemployment
    claims (see Rhode Island example in Criteria 4). Prior to the pandemic, Virginia’s
    Chief Data Officer spearheaded the creation of a roadmap for enhanced data integration
    and  use that allowed an [existing cross-agency data platform](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/june/headline-858149-en.html),
    initially launched to coordinate the opioid crisis , to be enhanced for the COVID-19
    response (see Virginia examples in Criteria 3, 4, and 5). These efforts demonstrate
    how states were able to use existing data infrastructure to rapidly provide or
    expand services and benefits during the COVID-19 crisis. \n"
  evidence_in_state_budgets_accordion: "States have also positioned themselves to
    [leverage](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/building-and-using-evidence.html)
    evidence and data infrastructure as part of the budget process. This approach
    to using evidence in fiscal decisions can foster innovation, build evidence of
    program effectiveness, and fund evidence-based programs that improve services
    for residents. With many states facing unprecedented budgetary decisions as a
    result of the COVID-19-induced recession, some states featured in the State Standard
    of Excellence have developed the capacity to [invest](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/investing-for-results.html)
    in evidence-based programs to deliver better outcomes for residents. \n\n\nFor
    example, Colorado’s FY 2020-2021 [budget development instructions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12rEZIkt1bzBcvF_b89Ps7Z0IJRDNuq7P)
    (pp. 10-12) required agencies to describe the evidence and body of research supporting
    any new program (see Colorado example in Criteria 9). Minnesota also issued [guidance](https://mn.gov/mmb/evidence/proposal/)
    on identifying evidence in budget proposals, which led to [$87 million](https://mn.gov/mmb-stat/2-gen/enacted-budget-ebp-investments.pdf)
    invested in new or expanded evidence-based programs in the FY 2020-2021 budget
    (see Minnesota example in Criteria 9). In 2019, the New Mexico legislature [defined](https://nmlegis.gov/Sessions/19%20Regular/final/SB0058.pdf#page=3)
    four tiers of evidence and [required](https://nmlegis.gov/Sessions/19%20Regular/final/SB0058.pdf#page=7)
    select agencies to identify their investments in evidence-based programs. As a
    result, the state legislature [recommended](https://govrel.unm.edu/legislative-sessions/2020/2021-legislative-budget.pdf#page=12)
    more than $13.6 million in additional spending for evidence-based human services
    programs (see New Mexico example in Criteria 9). \n\n\nTennessee, North Carolina,
    and Rhode Island demonstrated progress in leveraging evidence in their budget
    processes. North Carolina’s [budget process](https://files.nc.gov/ncosbm/documents/files/memo20191219_BudgetInstructions_FY2020-21.pdf#page=2)
    encouraged departments to identify and develop evidence-focused budget proposals
    (see North Carolina example in Criteria 9). Tennessee’s [Office of Evidence and
    Impact](https://www.tn.gov/transparenttn/tennessee-program-inventory/about.html),
    founded in 2019, spearheaded an [increased](https://www.tn.gov/finance/fa/fa-budget-information/budget-instructions-and-forms.html)
    use of evidence and research in the state budget process (see Tennessee examples
    in Criteria 6 and Criteria 9). In Rhode Island, the [FY 2021 budget instructions](http://www.omb.ri.gov/documents/instructions/1_FY%202021%20Budget%20Instructions.pdf#page=12)
    required agencies to describe program effectiveness and improvement of outcomes,
    rather than simply reporting activities and outputs (see Rhode Island example
    in Criteria 9). Collectively, these examples signaled a growing commitment across
    the country to leverage evidence in budget decisions in order to achieve improved
    results. "
