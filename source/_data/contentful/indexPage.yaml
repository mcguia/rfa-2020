    description: Did the state or any of its agencies invest at least 1% of program
      funds in evaluations?
    explanation: |-
      Making a specific commitment to evaluation is critical and ensures that state governments have the necessary funds to evaluate whether state programs are achieving their desired outcomes. At the federal level, several agencies have made commitments to spend 1% of program funds on evaluation, which has allowed them to improve programmatic outcomes and build their knowledge base about what works.
