    The 2018 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets a national standard – a “north star” – for how state governments can consistently and effectively use data and evidence in budget, policy, and management decisions to achieve better outcomes for their residents.

    - Results for America identified 88 leading and promising data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies, programs, and systems in effect in April 2018 in 30 states across the country.

    - Five states are recognized as leading the way with their data-driven and evidence-based examples: Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, and Tennessee.

    - We identified these examples across 15 criteria: Strategic Goals, Performance Management/Continuous Improvement, Data Leadership, Data Policies/Agreements, Data Use, Evaluation Leadership, Evaluation Policies, Evaluation Resources, Outcome Data, Evidence Definition and Program Inventory, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Use of Evidence in Grant Programs, Innovation, Contracting for Outcomes, and Repurpose for Results.

    The purpose of the 2018 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence is to inform policymakers and the public about state governments’ use of data, evidence, and evaluation to invest taxpayer dollars in what works. By identifying specific efforts currently underway in state governments, Results for America hopes to facilitate the broader adoption of evidence-based policymaking in state governments across the country.

    Results for America’s analysis is based on data provided under license by the [Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative) (which was used to inform its [2017 report](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2017/01/how-states-engage-in-evidence-based-policymaking) on states’ engagement in evidence-based policymaking) and input from more than 90 current and former state government officials and other experts.<sup>1</sup>

  short_description: "The 2019 Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence sets
    a national standard—a “north star”—for how state governments can consistently
    and effectively use evidence and data in budget, policy, and management decisions
    to achieve better outcomes for their residents.\n\nIn the 2019 Invest in What
    Works State Standard of Excellence (State Standard of Excellence), Results for
    America identified 125 examples of data-driven and evidence-based practices, policies,
    programs, and systems in effect as of June 2019 in 33 states across the country.\n\nOverall,
    five states are leading the way with their use of data-driven and evidence-based
    practices, policies, programs, and systems. These Leading States are Colorado,
    Minnesota, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Three states are Rising Stars that have
    significantly increased their evidence and data efforts: Maryland (from three
    promising examples in 2018 to six in 2019), Nevada (new leading example of using
    evidence in nine education grant programs), and North Carolina (from one promising
    example in 2018 to four in 2019).  \n\nThe 2019 State Standard of Excellence shows
    how state governments are using evidence and data to improve results for their
    residents by investing in what works. The examples of data-driven and evidence-based
    practices, policies, programs, and systems in the 2019 State Standard of Excellence
    demonstrate that state governments thrive when they incorporate evidence-based
    policy into their budget, policy, and management decisions. Moreover, the efforts
    of these state governments are informing their peers, policymakers, and the public
    about the effectiveness of using evidence and data to invest taxpayer dollars
    in what works. \n\nThe 2019 State Standard of Excellence demonstrates growing
    bipartisan momentum in state governments’ building and use of evidence and data.
    Between May 2018 and June 2019, Results for America identified an increase in
    the overall number of state government examples from 88 to 125, representing 33
    states (including five new states not represented in 2018: Arizona, Missouri,
    Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont). Particularly notable areas of growth were education
    with a 300% increase in the number of examples and workforce with a 400% increase.\n\nResults
    for America’s analysis is based on data provided under license by the [Pew-MacArthur
    Results First Initiative](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative)
    (which was used to inform its [2017 report](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2017/01/how-states-engage-in-evidence-based-policymaking)
    on states’ engagement in evidence-based policymaking) and input from more than
    150 current and former state government officials and other experts.<sup>1</sup>"
