      A 2014 Minnesota law (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the Self-Support Index to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, whereas counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” \[256J.626(7)(a)(2)].

      A 2016 Minnesota law (section 14, line 15.21) allows savings from reducing sentences for minor drug offenders to be applied to evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for those in prison and under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ own research which found (p. 26) that drug treatment reduces recidivism.
