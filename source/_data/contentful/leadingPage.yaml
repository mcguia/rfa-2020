      awarded grants to [12 community-based initiatives](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR17-003.aspx)
      to advance California’s goal of becoming the healthiest state in the nation
      by 2022. In the [selection process](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/innovation-challenge-2-0/),
      applications were scored based data use (“the extent to which data was effectively
      used to inform, target, and evaluate the innovation”) and effectiveness (“the
      extent to which the innovation’s results were achieved or show promise of being
      successful with the intended population”) among other criteria.\n\nIn 2011,
      the California Franchise Tax Board launched the [Enterprise Data to Revenue](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutftb/projects/edr/edr-1.shtml)
      project, a multiyear tax system modernization to increase efficiency and improve
      services for California taxpayers. The five-year project generated approximately
      $3.7 billion in additional revenue, with recurring additional revenue of $1
      billion annually, through five components: an automatic tax return service,
      a new data warehouse and analytics tool that incorporated legacy tax data, a
      new customer service interface, an improved case management system, and enhanced
      tools for collections. Launched in 2016, the [second phase of the project](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutftb/projects/edr/edr-2.shtml)
      will build on these improvements. \n\nCalifornia’s [Eureka Institute](https://www.govops.ca.gov/eureka/)
      “guides, supports, and integrates innovation and drives continuous improvement
      throughout state government” as a way to improve the impact of the state’s programs.
      The institute trains state employees on leadership, using open data, and Lean
      techniques, which are designed improve customer service."

      million in results-driven contracts that require providers to meet outcome goals
      rather than output metrics. This has led to a reduction in the number of children
      in group care by nearly 20%, reduced the number of children in state custody
      due to improved preventative services, expanded services available to families
      and children, and made improvements in the department’s procurement process.'

    long_description: |-
      A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, whereas counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” \[[256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)].

      A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows savings from reducing sentences for minor drug offenders to be applied to evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for those in prison and under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/) which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf) (p. 26) that drug treatment reduces recidivism.
