    California [Innovation Challenge 2.0](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/together/innovation-challenge-showcase/)
    awarded grants to [12 community-based initiatives](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR17-003.aspx)
    to advance California’s goal of becoming the healthiest state in the nation by
    2022. In the [selection process](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/innovation-challenge-2-0/),
    applications were scored based data use (“the extent to which data was effectively
    used to inform, target, and evaluate the innovation”) and effectiveness (“the
    extent to which the innovation’s results were achieved or show promise of being
    successful with the intended population”) among other criteria.\n\nIn 2011, the
    California Franchise Tax Board launched the [Enterprise Data to Revenue](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutftb/projects/edr/edr-1.shtml)
    project, a multiyear tax system modernization to increase efficiency and improve
    services for California taxpayers. The five-year project generated approximately
    $3.7 billion in additional revenue, with recurring additional revenue of $1 billion
    annually, through five components: an automatic tax return service, a new data
    warehouse and analytics tool that incorporated legacy tax data, a new customer
    service interface, an improved case management system, and enhanced tools for
    collections. Launched in 2016, the [second phase of the project](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutftb/projects/edr/edr-2.shtml)
    will build on these improvements. \n\nCalifornia’s [Eureka Institute](https://www.govops.ca.gov/eureka/)
    “guides, supports, and integrates innovation and drives continuous improvement
    throughout state government” as a way to improve the impact of the state’s programs.
    The institute trains state employees on leadership, using open data, and Lean
    techniques, which are designed improve customer service."

    A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, whereas counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” \[[256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)].

    A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows savings from reducing sentences for minor drug offenders to be applied to evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for those in prison and under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/) which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf) (p. 26) that drug treatment reduces recidivism.

  short_description: Since 2017, the Nevada Department of Education has allocated
    100% of the state’s $8.5 million in federal Title I school improvement funds to
    districts and schools for interventions backed by strong, moderate, or promising
    evidence.
  long_description: "Since 2017, the Nevada Department of Education has [allocated](http://www.doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/ndedoenvgov/content/TitleI/1003aapplication2017.pdf)
    100% of the state’s $8.5 million in federal Title I school improvement funds to
    districts and schools for interventions backed by strong, moderate, or promising
    evidence (using the top three tiers of evidence as [defined](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf#page=8)
    by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)). This represented an increase
    over the approximately 15% of funds that had been allocated based on level of
    evidence in the 2016-2017 school year. Grant recipients may set aside funds to
    monitor and evaluate the identified evidence-based approaches to ensure the investments
    yield a positive impact on student outcomes. Applications for Title I school improvement
    funds must meet at least one of Nevada’s three statewide  priorities: focus on
    the lowest performing schools, data-driven decision-making, and leadership development.
    \n\nBeginning in 2017, the Nevada Department of Education began requiring school
    districts to invest awarded funds from two additional federal grant programs in
    interventions that meet one of the four tiers of evidence (strong, moderate, promising,
    and under evaluation) [defined](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf#page=8)
    in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA): (1) [ESSA Title IV-B](http://www.doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/nde.doe.nv.gov/content/Grants/2018RFA-21stCCLCCURRENT.pdf)
    ($9 million in 2017-2018), for the competitive 21st Century Community Learning
    Centers grants and (2) Competitive [ESSA Title IV-A](http://www.doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/nde.doe.nv.gov/content/Grants/titleivrfa_.pdf)
    grants ($3 million in federal funds to Nevada in 2017-2018 to increase students’
    access to a well-rounded education), where applications with stronger evidence
    are considered for funding before other applications. Applications for Title IV-A
    must meet at least one of Nevada’s three statewide priorities: focus on the lowest
    performing schools, data-driven decision-making, and leadership development.\n\nStarting
    in 2013, the Nevada State Legislature passed a series of laws with strong evidence
    requirements that aligned state education funding with ESSA’s tiered evidence
    definition. The following six programs require grantees to use interventions that
    meet one of the four [ESSA evidence tiers](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf#page=8)
    (though supplemental curriculum and professional development must meet the top
    three tiers: strong, moderate, or promising) and align with one of Nevada’s three
    statewide priorities: focus on the lowest performing schools, data-driven decision-making,
    and leadership development: (1) The [Zoom School program](http://www.doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/ndedoenvgov/content/English_Language_Learners(ELL)/Zoom_Guidance_Document.pdf),
    first [enacted](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB504.pdf)
    in 2013 supports competitive grants ($50 million per year in state education funds)
    to help school districts provide English language instruction to non-native speakers;
    (2) the Nevada Turnaround grant program, [authorized](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/79th2017/Bill/5835/Overview)

    to support extended learning opportunities in schools (approximately $1,200 for
    every eligible student; 2019 total funding of $70 million in state funds per year);
    (4) the competitive [College and Career Readiness](http://www.doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/nde.doe.nv.gov/content/Grants/FY18_RFACollegeandCareerReadiness.pdf)

  long_description: "Since 2015, Rhode Island’s Department of Children, Youth, and
    Families (DCYF) has worked to [reform and restructure](https://govlab.hks.harvard.edu/rhode-island-department-children-youth-and-families-performance-improvement)
    the department’s procurement processes in four areas: improving service delivery
    through strategic planning, embedding results-driven procurement in new contracts,
    improving performance through active contract management practices, and supporting
    results-driven contracting practices through technical resources, tools, and processes
    for staff. As part of this initiative, the department executed $90 million in
    116 results-driven contracts that require providers to meet outcome goals rather
    than output metrics. As a result, DCYF has reduced the number of children in group
    care by over 20% since 2015, experienced a 50 percent expansion of foster care
    resources for the most challenging adolescents, doubled the capacity of high quality
    family visitation and reunification services, and made start-up investments of
    $1.2 million in nonprofit community organizations to support new and expanded
    programming.\n\nIn 2015, Rhode Island’s Department of Labor and Training launched
    Real Jobs Rhode Island, an innovative $14 million workforce program. To track
    the program’s success, Rhode Island [created](https://govlab.hks.harvard.edu/rhode-island-workforce-development)
    performance-based metrics and used frequent meetings with training providers to
    track results and make course corrections. As a result of this active contract
    management, Rhode Island was able to reconfigure the way it manages and [evaluates](http://www.dlt.ri.gov/realjobs/pdfs/ProgReportRJRI.pdf)
    its job training programs to capture meaningful long-term employment outcomes.
    The state also has created a Strategic Coaching Procurement Playbook, which includes
    [specific strategies](http://www.purchasing.ri.gov/StateAgencyInfoCenter/DocsForms/strategic-procurement-coaching-playbook.pdf#page=15)
    and [sample language](http://www.purchasing.ri.gov/StateAgencyInfoCenter/DocsForms/strategic-procurement-coaching-playbook.pdf#page=16)

    care, and funding. The dashboard also tracks the disparate impacts of the virus
    on communities of color to enhance collaboration with stakeholders and “eliminate
    systemic barriers so communities of color and indigenous communities can recover
    with dignity and resiliency.” Such a collaboration includes an ongoing partnership
    with J-PAL North America that has leveraged the data to identify how to increase
    take up of COVID-19 testing in Black, Latinx, immigrant, and Native American communities
    based on local priorities and preferences. The Governor regularly briefs the public

    individual agency data officers, are required to biannually update the state data
    plan, which covers open data and creates data standards for agencies. The plan
    also contains 11 principles and accompanying practices that all agencies should
    adopt in order to improve their management, use, sharing, and analysis of data.
    In 2019, the Office of Policy and Management created a new Data and Analytics
    Policy unit to further support the management, use, sharing, and analysis of data

    and organizations” through data integration and management tools. The executive
    order created a presumption of data-sharing between state agencies, except where
    a specific legal prohibition is identified in writing. Since its launch, InnovateOhio
    and the Ohio Department of Administrative Services have collaborated with state
    agencies to incorporate 1,600 information systems into the State’s cloud platform.
    As of June 2020, the InnovateOhio Platform recovered over $1 million in duplicate
    payments by applying a data analytics tool to state agency spending ledgers.

  long_description: "Since 2017, the Nevada Department of Education has allocated
    100% of the state’s $9.5 million in federal Title I school improvement funds to
    districts and schools for interventions backed by strong, moderate, or promising
    evidence (using the top three tiers of evidence as defined by the federal Every
    Student Succeeds Act [ESSA]). This represented an increase over the approximately
    15% of funds that had been allocated based on level of evidence in the 2016-2017
    school year. Grant recipients may set aside funds to monitor and evaluate the
    identified evidence-based approaches to ensure the investments yield a positive
    impact on student outcomes. \n\nBeginning in 2017, the Nevada Department of Education
    also began requiring school districts to invest awarded funds from two additional
    federal grant programs in interventions that meet one of the four tiers of evidence
    (strong, moderate, promising, and under evaluation) defined in ESSA: (1) ESSA
    Title IV-B ($9 million in 2017-2018), for the competitive 21st Century Community
    Learning Centers grants; and (2) ESSA Title IV-A grants ($9.4 million in federal
    funds to Nevada in 2017-2018 to increase students’ access to a well-rounded education),
    where applications with stronger evidence are considered for funding before other
    applications.\n\nStarting in 2013, the Nevada State Legislature passed a series
    of laws with strong evidence requirements that aligned state education funding
    with ESSA’s tiered evidence definition. The following six programs require grantees
    to use interventions that meet one of the four ESSA evidence tiers (though supplemental
    curriculum and professional development must meet the top three tiers: strong,
    moderate, or promising): \n1. Zoom School program, first enacted in 2013, supports
    competitive grants ($50 million per year in state education funds) to help school
    districts provide English language instruction to non-native speakers; \n2. Nevada
    Turnaround grant program, authorized in 2017, is a competitive grant program ($2
    million in state education funds per year) that helps underperforming schools
    implement their school improvement plans; \n3. SB 178, authorized in 2017, gives
    weighted formula grants to support extended learning opportunities in schools
    (approximately $1,200 for every eligible student; 2019 total funding of $70 million
    in state funds per year); \n4. College and Career Readiness, a competitive grant
    program ($4.9 million in state education funds per year), created in 2017, helps
    school districts establish advanced academic programs for middle school and high
    school students; \n5. Victory Schools initiative ($25 million in state education
    funds per year), created in 2015 (and reauthorized in 2019), aims to improve results
    in the state’s lowest-performing schools in the most underprivileged zip codes;
    and\n6. Read by Grade Three Act ($31 million in state funds in 2019-2020), amended
    in 2019, allocates funds to school districts through a formula grant process to
    support student literacy."

  long_description: "In 2020, California launched the California COVID Assessment
    Tool to identify potential COVID-19 hotspots, predict which hospitals might reach
    capacity, and proactively allocate resources to such hotspots. This innovative
    assessment tool is a “model of models,” which incorporates the statistical projections
    of several leading research institutions. Notably, the assessment tool allows
    residents to create their own scenarios for transmission potential in the coming
    months depending on specific public health guidelines. Further, California released
    the source data sets on California’s Open Data Portal, allowing the public to
    examine the data underlying the Assessment Tool. \n\nThe California Government
    Operations Agency (GovOps), which serves as an umbrella organization for the state’s
    innovation work, is designed to institutionalize policies, tools, and training
    that can drive its mission to modernize the processes of government through lean
    process improvement, data, leadership, and performance improvement. GovOps brings
    together statewide initiatives such as the Lean Academy, California Leadership
    Academy, the Office of Digital Innovation, and California’s Open Data Portal resources.
    As well, the California Health and Human Services Agency has an Office of Innovation
    that focuses on improving programs and services through the use of tools such
    as human-centered design and data analytics."

  long_description: "Since 2015, Rhode Island’s Department of Children, Youth, and
    Families has worked to reform and restructure the department’s procurement. As
    part of this initiative, the department executed $90 million in 116 results-driven
    contracts that require providers to meet outcome goals rather than output metrics.
    As a result, the Department has reduced the number of children in group care by
    over 20% since 2015, experienced a 50%expansion of foster care resources for the
    most challenging adolescents, doubled the capacity of high-quality family visitation
    and reunification services, and made start-up investments of $1.2 million in nonprofit
    community organizations to support new and expanded programming.\n\n\nAlso in
    2015, the Department of Labor and Training launched Real Jobs Rhode Island, an
    innovative, $14 million workforce program that used performance-based metrics
    and active contract management. As a result, the state reconfigured the way it
    manages and evaluates its job training programs to capture meaningful, long-term
    employment outcomes and created a Strategic Coaching Procurement Playbook, which
    includes specific strategies and sample language for using active contract management
    to achieve better results. \n\nRhode Island Works, administered by the Department
    of Human Services, also used performance payments and active contract management
    to improve its job search services, which, in 2015, ranked at the bottom nationally
    on the federal measure of work participation rate (which counts the number of
    recipients engaged in work-related activities as a share of all work-eligible
    clients receiving benefits). To improve the program, the Department partnered
    with the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab to incorporate performance-based
    payments for self-sufficiency outcomes and deploy active contract management.
    As a result, the federal participation rate improved by one-third within the first
    six months after these reforms were launched."

  long_description: Since 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has set
    performance targets for its community corrections program through performance-based
    contracts. Providers who meet recidivism prevention goals receive a 1% increase
    in their rate, while providers who fail to meet targets for two consecutive years
    can have their contracts terminated. Following the introduction of these performance
    goals, the program’s recidivism rate dropped by 11.3% in 2014, another 16% in
    2015, and an additional 11% in 2016. In 2018, the Commonwealth Foundation’s report
    on criminal justice reform in Pennsylvania recommended expanding the program to
    other areas based on these results.
