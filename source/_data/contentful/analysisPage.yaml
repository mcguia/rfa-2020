  blueprint_overlay2: 'The Blueprint identifies the action-oriented steps that state
    governments should take to build their capacity to use evidence and data to get
    better results through four themes: [Managing for Results](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/managing-for-results.html);
    [Leveraging Data](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/leveraging-data.html);
    [Building and Using Evidence](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/building-and-using-evidence.html);
    and [Investing for Results](https://blueprint.results4america.org/theme/investing-for-results.html).
    Each theme encompasses corresponding State Standard of Excellence criteria, providing
    state leaders a way to map their progress over time. In recent years, state governments
    have significantly increased the number of examples in the State Standard of Excellence
    criteria that correspond to these four Blueprint Themes, demonstrating that state
    leaders are building their capacity to use evidence and data. In future years,
    state leaders can continue to make progress in the State Standard of Excellence
    by implementing the Blueprintâ€™s Strategies and Actions.'
  example_growth: The Blueprint for Delivering Results in State Government serves
    as an implementation guide for the State Standard of Excellence. For strategies
    and actions to achieve excellence in these themes and criteria, [visit the Blueprint

    of State Standard of Excellence examples by Blueprint theme from 2018-2020.
