  description: Did the state or any of its agencies have an evaluation policy, evaluation
    plan, and research/learning agenda(s) and did it publicly release the findings
    of all completed evaluations?
  explanation: Evaluation policies provide a useful way for state governments to align
    their evaluation and research priorities, learn about what works, and share information
    with outside researchers about additional areas where they want to increase their
    knowledge base.

  explanation: Making a specific commitment to evaluation is critical and ensures
    that state governments have the necessary funds to evaluate whether state programs
    are achieving their desired outcomes. At the federal level, several agencies have
    made commitments to spend 1% of program funds on evaluation, which has allowed
    them to improve programmatic outcomes and build their knowledge base about what
    works.

      A [2007 Tennessee law](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/) requires that 100% of the state’s juvenile justice funding be evidence-based ([section 4e](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/)) beginning in 2012, with the exception of pilot programs that are building the evidence basis for research or theory-based interventions. As a result, the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services’ 2017 [Request for Proposal](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/dcs/documents/for-providers/procurement/Grant_AOF_Mandatory_Reqs.pdf) for juvenile justice services noted that “the Department of Children’s Services is prohibited from expending state funds on any juvenile justice program . . . unless the program is evidence-based” (p. 23). The law also established [in 37-5-121(a)] the following four levels of evidence for the juvenile justice programs operated by the Department of Children’s Services: evidence-based, research-based, theory-based, or pilot.

      The 2010 [Complete College Tennessee Act](https://www.tbr.edu/sites/tbr.edu/files/media/2015/01/Complete%20College%20TN%20Act%202010%20-%20signed.pdf) included provisions for using evidence of effectiveness in the funding system for public colleges and universities in the state. The competitive [outcomes-based funding system](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/thec/bureau/fiscal_admin/fiscal_pol/obff/1_-_Outcomes_Based_Funding_Formula_Overview_-_One_Page.pdf) allocates state funds based on student progress and completion metrics, rather than traditional enrollment-based criteria.

      $3.7 billion in additional revenue, with recurring additional revenue of $1
      billion annually, through five components: an automatic tax return service,
      a new data warehouse and analytics tool that incorporated legacy tax data, a
      new customer service interface, an improved case management system, and enhanced
      tools for collections. Launched in 2016, the [second phase of the project](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutftb/projects/edr/edr-2.shtml)
      will build on these improvements. \n\nCalifornia’s [Eureka Institute](https://www.govops.ca.gov/eureka/)

      throughout state government” as a way to improve the impact of the state’s programs.

      responses (and payment) of delinquent taxes. The randomized controlled trial
      found that by rewording delinquent tax notifications, the state could increase
      the payments it collected by up to 4.1% for no additional cost. Based on this
      experiment, Colorado is expanding these techniques to other departments and

      A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, whereas counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” \[[256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)].

      A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows savings from reducing sentences for minor drug offenders to be applied to evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for those in prison and under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/) which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf) (p. 26) that drug treatment reduces recidivism.

      Providers that meet recidivism prevention goals receive a 1% increase in their
      rate while providers that fail to meet targets for two consecutive years can
      have their contracts terminated. In 2014–2015, the program’s recidivism rate
      dropped by 11.3%.
