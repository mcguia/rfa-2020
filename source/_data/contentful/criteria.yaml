    Making a specific commitment to evaluation is critical and ensures that state governments have the necessary funds to evaluate whether state programs are achieving their desired outcomes. At the federal level, several agencies have made commitments to spend 1% of program funds on evaluation, which has allowed them to improve programmatic outcomes and build their knowledge base about what works.

      Beginning in 2011, the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) has [required programs that receive its grant funding](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 13) to “allocate a percentage of their OASAS funded prevention efforts to the delivery of evidence-based programs and strategies.” The percentage started at [35% in 2011](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) (p. 14) and escalated to 50% in 2014 and 70% in 2018. To assist in the implementation of evidence-based programs, OASAS created a [Registry of Evidence-based Programs](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/documents/2014PreventionGuidelines.pdf) and Strategies (p. 12). Promising programs can be proposed to a [state panel for approval and inclusion](http://www.npnconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NPN2016-OASAS-EBP-Panel_Part-1and2.PowerPoint.pdf) in the [OASAS registry](https://www.oasas.ny.gov/prevention/evidence/EBPSList.cfm).

      The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services has increased its funding of evidence-based interventions, targeting [75% of its alternative to incarceration funds](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/11/rf_nys_case_study.pdf) (pp. 5–6) toward evidence-based interventions in FY2015–2016. This funding target was based on the department’s [technical report](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/rf-technical_report_cba1_oct2013.pdf) and [cost-benefit analysis](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/resultsfirst/net-impact-table-with-guide.pdf) to outline the impact, costs, and benefits of specific criminal justice interventions.

      A [2007 Tennessee law](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/) requires that 100% of the state’s juvenile justice funding be evidence-based ([section 4e](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2016/title-37/chapter-5/part-1/section-37-5-121/)) beginning in 2012, with the exception of pilot programs that are building the evidence basis for research or theory-based interventions. As a result, the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services’ 2017 [Request for Proposal](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/dcs/documents/for-providers/procurement/Grant_AOF_Mandatory_Reqs.pdf) for juvenile justice services noted that “the Department of Children’s Services is prohibited from expending state funds on any juvenile justice program . . . unless the program is evidence-based” (p. 23). The law also established [in 37-5-121(a)] the following four levels of evidence for the juvenile justice programs operated by the Department of Children’s Services: evidence-based, research-based, theory-based, or pilot.

      A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, whereas counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” \[[256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)].

      A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows savings from reducing sentences for minor drug offenders to be applied to evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for those in prison and under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/) which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf) (p. 26) that drug treatment reduces recidivism.

The Center brings together [eleven partners](https://erdc.wa.gov/research-partners/our-partners), including state workforce, education, and child welfare agencies, to compile education and workforce data to improve student achievement and workforce outcomes.

      The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services maintains an [Integrated Client Database](http://www.aisp.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WAState_CaseStudy.pdf) with data from [10 state agencies](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/sites/default/files/SESA/rda/documents/research-11-205.pdf), 40 separate data systems, and 2.4 million individuals. This data is used for rapid-cycle policy analysis, program evaluation, [predictive modeling](https://ocio-website-files.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Digital-States-Survey-PRISM-Predictive-Risk-App.pdf), and performance measurement to help agencies understand how health and other factors are related to outcomes for persons served by public assistance programs. The database has been used by the state’s [Health Home Program](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/altsa/washington-health-home-program), which provides intensive care management services to high-risk Medicaid beneficiaries, to improve beneficiary health outcomes and lower costs. These lower costs have included [over $20 million in savings](https://www.cms.gov/blog/washington-mffs-preliminary-evaluation-report) to the state as well as tens of millions in dollars in shared savings [payments](https://www.hca.wa.gov/about-hca/health-home-program-saves-more-100-million-medicare-program-over-three-years) from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has [evaluated](https://innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/fai-wa-secondevalrpt.pdf) the program and encouraged other states to consider developing similar programs.

      A [2014 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626) (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the [Self-Support Index](https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2016/other/160886.pdf) to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, and counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multiyear plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” (Section [256J.626(7)(a)(2)](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256J.626)).

      A [2016 Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?version=latest&session=ls89&number=SF3481&session_year=2016&session_number=0) (section 14, line 15.21) allows the state to use the savings achieved from reducing the sentences of minor drug offenders for evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for offenders still in prison or under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ [own research](https://mn.gov/doc/data-publications/research/), which [found](https://mn.gov/doc/assets/03-10CDTXEvaluationReport_Revised_tcm1089-275973.pdf#page=29) that providing offenders drug treatment reduces recidivism rates.

      indigenous communities can recover with dignity and resiliency.” Such a collaboration

      the data to identify how to increase take up of COVID-19 testing in Black, Latinx,
      immigrant, and Native American communities based on local priorities and preferences.

      The plan also contains 11 principles and accompanying practices that all agencies
      should adopt in order to improve their management, use, sharing, and analysis
      of data. In 2019, the Office of Policy and Management created a new Data and
      Analytics Policy unit to further support the management, use, sharing, and analysis

    long_description: "Since 2017, the Nevada Department of Education has allocated
      100% of the state’s $9.5 million in federal Title I school improvement funds
      to districts and schools for interventions backed by strong, moderate, or promising
      evidence (using the top three tiers of evidence as defined by the federal Every
      Student Succeeds Act [ESSA]). This represented an increase over the approximately
      15% of funds that had been allocated based on level of evidence in the 2016-2017
      school year. Grant recipients may set aside funds to monitor and evaluate the
      identified evidence-based approaches to ensure the investments yield a positive
      impact on student outcomes. \n\nBeginning in 2017, the Nevada Department of
      Education also began requiring school districts to invest awarded funds from
      two additional federal grant programs in interventions that meet one of the
      four tiers of evidence (strong, moderate, promising, and under evaluation) defined
      in ESSA: (1) ESSA Title IV-B ($9 million in 2017-2018), for the competitive
      21st Century Community Learning Centers grants; and (2) ESSA Title IV-A grants
      ($9.4 million in federal funds to Nevada in 2017-2018 to increase students’
      access to a well-rounded education), where applications with stronger evidence
      are considered for funding before other applications.\n\nStarting in 2013, the
      Nevada State Legislature passed a series of laws with strong evidence requirements
      that aligned state education funding with ESSA’s tiered evidence definition.
      The following six programs require grantees to use interventions that meet one
      of the four ESSA evidence tiers (though supplemental curriculum and professional
      development must meet the top three tiers: strong, moderate, or promising):
      \n1. Zoom School program, first enacted in 2013, supports competitive grants
      ($50 million per year in state education funds) to help school districts provide
      English language instruction to non-native speakers; \n2. Nevada Turnaround
      grant program, authorized in 2017, is a competitive grant program ($2 million
      in state education funds per year) that helps underperforming schools implement
      their school improvement plans; \n3. SB 178, authorized in 2017, gives weighted
      formula grants to support extended learning opportunities in schools (approximately
      $1,200 for every eligible student; 2019 total funding of $70 million in state
      funds per year); \n4. College and Career Readiness, a competitive grant program
      ($4.9 million in state education funds per year), created in 2017, helps school
      districts establish advanced academic programs for middle school and high school
      students; \n5. Victory Schools initiative ($25 million in state education funds
      per year), created in 2015 (and reauthorized in 2019), aims to improve results
      in the state’s lowest-performing schools in the most underprivileged zip codes;
      and\n6. Read by Grade Three Act ($31 million in state funds in 2019-2020), amended
      in 2019, allocates funds to school districts through a formula grant process
      to support student literacy."

      As part of this initiative, the department executed $90 million in 116 results-driven
      contracts that require providers to meet outcome goals rather than output metrics.
      As a result, the Department has reduced the number of children in group care
      by over 20% since 2015, experienced a 50%expansion of foster care resources
      for the most challenging adolescents, doubled the capacity of high-quality family
      visitation and reunification services, and made start-up investments of $1.2
      million in nonprofit community organizations to support new and expanded programming.\n\n\nAlso
      in 2015, the Department of Labor and Training launched Real Jobs Rhode Island,
      an innovative, $14 million workforce program that used performance-based metrics
      and active contract management. As a result, the state reconfigured the way

      on the federal measure of work participation rate (which counts the number of
      recipients engaged in work-related activities as a share of all work-eligible
      clients receiving benefits). To improve the program, the Department partnered
      with the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab to incorporate performance-based
      payments for self-sufficiency outcomes and deploy active contract management.
      As a result, the federal participation rate improved by one-third within the

    long_description: 'In 2019, the Arizona Department of Child Safety partnered with
      the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab to improve upon the existing
      rate of nearly one in five families receiving supportive in-home preservation
      services that were re-reported for maltreatment, which resulted in the removal
      of a child from that home. Through active contract management, implementing
      uniform performance measures for providers, and establishing a unit to oversee
      child and family service contracts, the Department was able to reduce the number
      of families re-reported by 40% and the number child removals by 50%. '

  explanation: "*Repurposing funds from programs that fail to consistently achieve
    results to programs that consistently achieve results is a key strategy for state
    governments to improve their performance while building knowledge about what works.*"

    long_description: Since 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has set
      performance targets for its community corrections program through performance-based
      contracts. Providers who meet recidivism prevention goals receive a 1% increase
      in their rate, while providers who fail to meet targets for two consecutive
      years can have their contracts terminated. Following the introduction of these
      performance goals, the program’s recidivism rate dropped by 11.3% in 2014, another
      16% in 2015, and an additional 11% in 2016. In 2018, the Commonwealth Foundation’s
      report on criminal justice reform in Pennsylvania recommended expanding the
      program to other areas based on these results.

      A 2014 Minnesota law (subdivision 7) requires the Minnesota Department of Human Services to use the Self-Support Index to monitor each county’s performance in assisting clients to become self-sufficient. Counties that meet performance targets receive a 2.5% bonus payment from the state, and counties that perform below the expected target must submit a performance improvement plan. In counties where “no improvement is shown by the end of the multi-year plan, the county’s or tribe’s allocation must be decreased by 2.5 percent” (Section 256J.626(7)(a)(2)).

      A 2016 Minnesota law (section 14, line 15.21) allows the state to use the savings achieved from reducing the sentences of minor drug offenders for evidence-based drug and mental health treatments for offenders still in prison or under supervised release. The evidence to support this law comes from the Department of Corrections’ own research, which found that providing offenders drug treatment reduces recidivism rates.
